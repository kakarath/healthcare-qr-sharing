```bash
GET /api/compliance
```
**Response**:
```json
{
  "encryption": "AES-256-GCM",
  "authentication": "BCrypt + Session",
  "auditLogging": "Enabled",
  "backupRetention": "7 years",
  "accessControl": "Role-based",
  "hipaaCompliance": "98%"
}
```

## üîß **TESTING THE ENHANCEMENTS**

### **Test Account Lockout**
```bash
# Test failed login attempts (will lock after 3 attempts)
for i in {1..4}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"wrong"}'
done
```

### **Test Purpose Validation**
```bash
# This will fail (purpose too short)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/qr/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"purpose":"test"}'

# This will succeed (purpose descriptive)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/qr/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"purpose":"Emergency department visit for chest pain evaluation"}'
```
